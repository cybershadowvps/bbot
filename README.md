## Installation

```bash
# stable version
pipx install bbot

# bleeding edge (dev branch)
pipx install --pip-args '\--pre' bbot

## What is BBOT?

### BBOT is...

## 1) A Subdomain Finder

Passive API sources plus a recursive DNS brute-force with target-specific subdomain mutations.

```bash
# find subdomains of evilcorp.com
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p subdomain-enum
```

<details>
<summary><b>subdomain-enum.yml</b></summary>

```yaml
description: Enumerate subdomains via APIs, brute-force

flags:
  - subdomain-enum

output_modules:
  - subdomains

config:
  modules:
    stdout:
      format: text
      # only output DNS_NAMEs to the console
      event_types:
        - DNS_NAME
      # only show in-scope subdomains
      in_scope_only: True
      # display the raw subdomains, nothing else
      event_fields:
        - data
      # automatically dedupe
      accept_dups: False
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>SEE: Comparison to Other Subdomain Enumeration Tools</b></summary>

BBOT consistently finds 20-50% more subdomains than other tools. The bigger the domain, the bigger the difference. To learn how this is possible, see [How It Works](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/how_it_works/).

</details>


## 2) A Web Spider

```bash
# crawl evilcorp.com, extracting emails and other goodies
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p spider
```

## 3) An Email Gatherer

```bash
# enumerate evilcorp.com email addresses
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p subdomain-enum spider email-enum
```

## 4) A Web Scanner

```bash
# run a light web scan against www.evilcorp.com
bbot -t www.evilcorp.com -p web-basic

# run a heavy web scan against www.evilcorp.com
bbot -t www.evilcorp.com -p web-thorough
```

## 5) ...And Much More

```bash
# everything everywhere all at once
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p kitchen-sink

# roughly equivalent to:
bbot -t evilcorp.com -p subdomain-enum cloud-enum code-enum email-enum spider web-basic paramminer dirbust-light web-screenshots
```

## 6) It's Also a Python Library

#### Synchronous
```python
from bbot.scanner import Scanner

scan = Scanner("evilcorp.com", presets=["subdomain-enum"])
for event in scan.start():
    print(event)
```

#### Asynchronous
```python
from bbot.scanner import Scanner

async def main():
    scan = Scanner("evilcorp.com", presets=["subdomain-enum"])
    async for event in scan.async_start():
        print(event.json())

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Feature Overview

BBOT (Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool) is a recursive internet scanner inspired by [Spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot), but designed to be faster, more reliable, and friendlier to pentesters, bug bounty hunters, and developers.

Special features include:

- Support for Multiple Targets
- Web Screenshots
- Suite of Offensive Web Modules
- AI-powered Subdomain Mutations
- Native Output to Neo4j (and more)
- Python API + Developer Documentation

## Targets

BBOT accepts an unlimited number of targets via `-t`. You can specify targets either directly on the command line or in files (or both!):

```bash
bbot -t evilcorp.com evilcorp.org 1.2.3.0/24 -f subdomain-enum
```

Targets can be any of the following:

- `DNS_NAME` (`evilcorp.com`)
- `IP_ADDRESS` (`1.2.3.4`)
- `IP_RANGE` (`1.2.3.0/24`)
- `OPEN_TCP_PORT` (`192.168.0.1:80`)
- `URL` (`https://www.evilcorp.com`)

For more information, see [Targets](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/#targets-t). To learn how BBOT handles scope, see [Scope](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/#scope).

## API Keys

Similar to Amass or Subfinder, BBOT supports API keys for various third-party services such as SecurityTrails, etc.

The standard way to do this is to enter your API keys in **`~/.config/bbot/bbot.yml`**:
```yaml
modules:
  shodan_dns:
    api_key: 4f41243847da693a4f356c0486114bc6
  c99:
    api_key: 21a270d5f59c9b05813a72bb41707266
  virustotal:
    api_key: dd5f0eee2e4a99b71a939bded450b246
  securitytrails:
    api_key: d9a05c3fd9a514497713c54b4455d0b0
```

If you like, you can also specify them on the command line:
```bash
bbot -c modules.virustotal.api_key=dd5f0eee2e4a99b71a939bded450b246
```
